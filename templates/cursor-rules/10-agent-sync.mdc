## agent-sync conventions

All coordination memos live under:

`/.orchestration/runtime/agent-sync/`

### Memo requirements

Include:

- Date
- Audience (`@integrator` etc.)
- Status (`ready-to-consume` etc.)
- Branch + SHA (when applicable)

### Handoffs

When your work is safe for others to build on, post a `ready-to-consume` memo.
