## Orchestration framework (required)

This project uses the **Generic Orchestration Framework**.

### Runtime directories (encapsulated)

- `.orchestration/runtime/agent-sync/`: memos + task cards (runtime artifact)
- `.orchestration/runtime/iterations/`: iteration artifacts + agent CLI logs (runtime artifact)
- `.orchestration/config/`: orchestration configuration (commit-able)

### Command shorthand

You must understand and follow the command shorthand protocol documented in:

- `.orchestration/runtime/agent-sync/COMMAND_SHORTHAND.md`

### Coordination (memos)

Use structured memos in `.orchestration/runtime/agent-sync/` with statuses:

- `draft` | `ready-to-consume` | `ready-to-merge` | `blocked`

### Multi-agent concurrency

When multiple agents work concurrently:

- Each agent should work in an isolated git branch/worktree.
- Handoffs happen through memos (ready-to-consume) and integrator convergence.

### Cursor CLI (agent)

Cursor CLI is available via `agent` (see docs: `https://cursor.com/docs/cli/overview`).
The orchestrator may invoke `agent` to run tasks automatically.
