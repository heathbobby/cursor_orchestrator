# Cursor Agent Bootstrap (Project)

This file is generated by the orchestration framework bootstrap to configure agents working in this project.

## Runtime locations (do not commit)

- `.orchestration/runtime/agent-sync/`
- `.orchestration/runtime/iterations/`

## Configuration (commit-able)

- `.orchestration/config/`
  - `framework.yaml` (project orchestration settings)
  - `workflows/` (workflow YAML configs)

## Command shorthand

Read and follow:

- `.orchestration/runtime/agent-sync/COMMAND_SHORTHAND.md`

## Default workflow loop

1. Orchestrator generates tasks:
   - `/orchestrator::start_workflow(<workflow>, <phase>, <iteration>)`
2. Agents execute tasks (manual or via Cursor CLI):
   - `agent -p ...` (see `https://cursor.com/docs/cli/overview`)
3. Agents post `ready-to-consume` memos.
4. Integrator converges:
   - `/integrator::apply_ready(...)`
