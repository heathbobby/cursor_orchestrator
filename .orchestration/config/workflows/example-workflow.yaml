description: Example workflow showing multi-agent task execution

phases:
  - id: phase-1
    name: Execution
    description: Execute tasks with specialized agents

    iterations:
      - id: iteration-1
        name: Task Execution
        description: Agents execute assigned tasks

        goal: |
          Execute tasks using specialized agents, each working in isolated
          worktrees to prevent conflicts.
