###IDEAS for Future Framework Enhancements (In no particular order)###
* Add step in the bootstrapping process to have an agent derive roles and customizations of instructions for the agent roles that are specific to the target project.  This agent is a orchestration-framework design specialist.
* Add a project ingestion phase to the bootstrap process wherein the framework "learns" about the project and creates all the necessary artifacts to ensure the agents will participate in the project in the best way possible. 
* Apply updates after project bootstrap completed to keep framework current in target project(s).
* Create a WebUI for viewing the agent orchestration process and current status.
* External task management integration (github, jira, etc)
* Progressive knowledgebase building and refining functionality for target project as a whole and for the agent roles in particular
* Progressive orchestrator/agent prompt refinement from evaluations of effectiveness of prompt during iteration validation.
* Create a set of common project patterns that can be used by the bootstrap process to initialize a new project.  Maybe from a project template? 

* Create a VS Code extension that does the same thing as the WebUI in that is allows the user to view the Agent orchestration process and current status
